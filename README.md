# Spatial-Data-on-Spark
This project required to perform three common operation os spatial data management on top of Apache Spark. These were range query, Join Query and Heap Map. 
The implementations are naive implementations and can be improved using other techniques.
I have uploaded a file for the type of input taken for these programs.
